# Agency Client Interview Skill

Governs the client discovery process for AI Agency projects. Provides structured question flows, progressive disclosure of interview depth, and context file generation for `.agency/context/`.

---

## Static Zone

### Identity

**Purpose**: Define interview question frameworks, context gathering strategies, and structured output formats for populating `.agency/context/` files during project onboarding.

**Input Contract**:
- User request (natural language description of desired project)
- Existing `.agency/context/` files (may be empty on first run)

**Output Contract**:
- Populated `.agency/context/` files:
  - `brand-voice.md` — tone, style, language preferences
  - `target-audience.md` — customer personas, pain points
  - `visual-identity.md` — colors, fonts, imagery preferences
  - `tech-preferences.md` — framework, hosting, integrations
  - `quality-standards.md` — performance targets, accessibility level

**Owner**: `.agency/context/target-audience.md`

### Core Principles

> Derived from Brand Context. Never auto-modified. Manual editing only.

1. Empathetic questioning — understand the WHY before the WHAT
2. Progressive disclosure — start broad, drill down based on answers
3. Business-first — always connect technical decisions to business outcomes
4. No assumptions — ask, don't guess (especially for brand voice and audience)
5. Respect user's time — skip questions already answered in context files

### Default Interview Flow

**Phase 1: Business Context (3 questions)**
1. What is the primary business objective for this project?
2. Who is your target customer? (age, role, pain points)
3. What does success look like? (specific KPIs if possible)

**Phase 2: Brand Identity (3 questions)**
4. How would you describe your brand voice? (3-5 adjectives)
5. Are there reference sites or brands you admire?
6. Any design preferences or constraints? (colors, style, existing brand guidelines)

**Phase 3: Technical Scope (2 questions)**
7. What pages/sections do you need?
8. Any technical requirements? (framework, hosting, integrations)

**Phase 4: Quality Expectations (1 question)**
9. What matters most to you? (speed, design quality, mobile experience, SEO)

### Adaptive Behavior

- If `.agency/context/` files already have content, skip covered questions
- If user has completed 5+ projects, reduce to 3 key questions only
- Learn which questions users skip or answer briefly → reduce priority
